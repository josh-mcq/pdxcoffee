=========

This is the first dynamic, php website I have built. It was built with the help of SitePoint's book: "Build a database driven website with PHP and MySQL".  The purpose is provide a website and backend database to house and display essential information about coffeeshops in Portland.  All data is manually input, and may or may not be accurate as site has not been maintained for public use.
